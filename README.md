A challenge given to me during my internship with RSI
June 19.2019 - 9:48a - uploaded test file to GitHub

June 19.2019 - 10.25a - Real file uploaded. Icons from FontAwesome were inserted via using classes and linking to the external CSS page to bring the icons into the page. At this stage, they're showing up like black icons.

June 19.2019 - 10.37a - Worked on adding some style to the page. Made a grey background and gave the body a foundation for the rest of the page. I also went ahead and centered the icons with the class .scene to ensure their location.

June 19.2019 - 10:53a - added lines 12-19 in RocketFuel.css to create a simple circle in the center of the screen where the icons will eventually show themselves. width, height, background, border, border-radius and overflow where all added under .scene {}
